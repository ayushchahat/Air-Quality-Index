# Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of air quality trends across various cities in India, using AQI data to visualize the levels of pollution in both highly polluted and least polluted cities. The data is displayed through a Power BI dashboard that allows users to gain insights into air pollution metrics such as AQI, CO, NO, SO2, and PM2.5.

## Features

- **AQI Trends Over Time**: Visualize air quality trends from 2015 to 2020 for multiple cities, allowing you to see changes in pollution levels over the years.
- **Top 10 Polluted Cities**: Shows the cities with the highest average AQI values, helping identify the most polluted regions.
- **Top 10 Least Polluted Cities**: Displays the cities with the lowest average AQI values, highlighting areas with cleaner air.
- **Pollutant Breakdown**: Detailed averages for specific pollutants like Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxide (NO), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Particulate Matter (PM2.5).

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and interactive dashboards.
- **Data Source**: Air quality data from reliable sources (specific data source not mentioned).

## How to Use

1. Open the Power BI dashboard.
2. Use the filters to select cities and time periods for detailed analysis.
3. View pollutant breakdowns and city-wise AQI rankings.

## Insights

- **Most Polluted City**: As per the data, **Delhi** ranks as one of the most polluted cities with an AQI of 452.12.
- **Least Polluted City**: **Mumbai** ranks among the least polluted with a low AQI value.
- **Yearly Trends**: The dashboard captures AQI trends over six years, providing a historical perspective on air quality.

## Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard includes various charts and graphs such as:
- AQI trends over the years.
- Bar charts for comparing AQI across cities.
- Maps to visualize city pollution levels geographically.
